#NuPace Calculator is a mobile application developed by a team of five Android developers. This project was created during the 1st Hack Sprint organized by the DevSpace community. NuPace Calculator is designed to support runners in their training by offering a pace calculator.

A pace calculator is an essential tool for runners and other athletes who engage in activities that involve distance and time. The importance of a pace calculator lies in its ability to help runners make informed decisions and improvements in their training and racing endeavors.
